# Late Evening Colorscheme for Vim

This is a high-contrast, dark colorscheme for Vim that was forked from the `evening` colorscheme that ships with vim.

After years of use, and countless hacks to get `evening` working properly, I got fed up and remade the colorscheme, keeping the same overall feel.

**Attention has been paid to get high color terminals to have almost exactly the same colors as GUI vim.** ([example](#screenshots)) Use a terminal or GUI -- it's up to you.

Some compromises were made on 16-color terminals but that's to be expected, and won't apply to you if you use `TERM=xterm-256color`.
